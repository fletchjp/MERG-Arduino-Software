# TestTasks

I want to test the use of IOAbstraction and TaskManagerIO with the Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040

## simpleTasks

This is from the TaskManagerIO example routines and runs on a Pico.

## simpleTasks2core

This is modified from the TaskManagerIO example routines and runs on a Pico using both cores.

## timedBlink

This is a simple example of IOAbstraction and runs on a Pico.

## i2CEepromExample

I have only just found out that IOAbstraction has an EEPROM interface.

I have now run this example on a Mega. It would need to be altered for a Pico.

I then forgot to put this with the other EEPROM tests so I have spent some time hunting for it.
