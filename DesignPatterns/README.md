Under development.

## Introduction

The Composite and Observer Patterns are well known and described in the Design Patterns book and elsewhere.

These implementations are adapted from various published codes.

The Composite Pattern provide a way of combining objects in Arduino code.

The Observer Pattern can then be use to provide for Observer objects to receive messages when a Subject object changes.

## composite.h

Implements the Composite Pattern

## observer.h 

Implements the Observer Pattern.

## combined.h 

Implements a pattern combining the Composite pattern with the Subjects of the Observer Pattern. It uses observer.h 

## Usagee

See the examples.
