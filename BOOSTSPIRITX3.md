# Boost Spirit X3 (Version 3)

I did not think that this was available with BoostForArduino (Boost 1.66.0).

It turns out that it is with an early version 3.0.0.

I have now copied version 3.0.9 from Boost 1.77.0 and I am using that within Boost 1.66.0 which has worked with one or two tweaks of the rest of Boost Spirit.

I have had some difficulty finding why it did not compile and sorting it out so that it now does.

I was going to explore it in parallel with version 2 which I have been using up until now. I am now concentrating on X3.


I understand that one of the differences is that it no longer uses Boost Phoenix and Boost Proto.

I have listened to the beginning of a talk by Joel De Guzman when he was starting on X3. Interesting.

There was due to be a version of karma for X3 which does not exist yet.

I am working through the Boost Spirit X3 examples. These take the user through a series of stages which introduce the features of X3 in an organised way.

I have now solved a problem of some warning messages by adding -Wno-pasabi to the cpp flags.

There are a lot of examples now and I am going to divide up this page into groups on separate

[Boost Spirit X3 initial examples](BOOSTSPIRITX3Initial.md) the ones previously documented here.
