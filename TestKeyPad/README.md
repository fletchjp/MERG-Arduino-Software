# Test Keypad

These are a set of programs being used to test programming with a Keypad

There are two types of keypad, both with 4 rows of keys. One sort have three columns and the other four columns.

I have code to support both types.

I also want to support direct pin access from an Arduino MEGA and I2C access from an Arduino UNO or NANO.

I have developed some codes for testing the different applications.
