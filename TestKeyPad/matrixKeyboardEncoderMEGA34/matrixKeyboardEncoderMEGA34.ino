/// @brief Example of matrix keyboard support for MEGA 3 by 4 Keypad built into IoAbstraction adding encoder
///
/// This is now adapted to report the state of the key.
///
/// This example shows how to use the matrix keyboard support that's built into IoAbstraction,
/// it can be used out the box with either a 3x4 or 4x4 keypad, but you can modify it to use
/// any matrix keyboard quite easily.
/// It just sends the characters that are typed on the keyboard to Serial. The keyboard in This
/// example is connected directly to Arduino pins, but could just as easily be connected over
/// a PCF8574, MCP23017 or other IoAbstraction.
/// This version sets up the keyboard adapting the custom_keyboard example.
