# Quantum Mechanics

These examples are to explore the Numerov Algorithm which I have only just heard about.

## Shrodinger

Example code in C++.

This is finding some solutions now.

I have been exploring the effect of the various parameters.

It does now find all of the roots up to a certain point and it sometimes finds spurious ones.

I think the eigenvalues (energies) should be 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, etc.

## SimpleRoot
 
 This contains a class Bisect to find a root by the bisection method.
 
## TestTriDiagonal

Incomplete code to start using the algorithm for tridiagonal matrix solution.
