# GitHub Reflection

This is a page for reflection on my learning experience using this system.

I have been learning more about how to use GitHub. In particular one of the repositories I have forked had been updated. I have been learning how to keep my fork up to date. My source for this has been the video of Sven Rosvall's talk.
