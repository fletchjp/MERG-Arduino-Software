# GitHub Reflection

This is a page for reflection on my learning experience using this system.

I have been learning more about how to use GitHub. In particular one of the repositories I have forked had been updated. I have been learning how to keep my fork up to date. My source for this has been the video of Sven Rosvall's talk.

I think it is worth recording where I started at the beginning of this work. I had used git before some years ago and had not used GitHub then. I met GitHub when I started to look into using MERG-DEV which was already the site for MERG CBUS PIC codes and some other things.

I set up this site in August 2020 and did little with it. I did some more in late November 2020. I really only got going seriously in February 2021 with the first of Sven's talks and really have collaboration running only since his second (third) talk.
