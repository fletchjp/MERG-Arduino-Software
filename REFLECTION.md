# GitHub Reflection

This is a page for reflection on my learning experience using this system.

I have been learning more about how to use GitHub. In particular one of the repositories I have forked had been updated. I have been learning how to keep my fork up to date. My source for this has been the video of Sven Rosvall's talk.

I think it is worth recording where I started at the beginning of this work. I had used git before some years ago and had not used GitHub then. I met GitHub when I started to look into using MERG-DEV which was already the site for MERG CBUS PIC codes and some other things.

I set up this site in August 2020 and did little with it. I did some more in late November 2020. I really only got going seriously in February 2021 with the first of Sven's talks and really have collaboration running only since his second (third) talk.

## Experience

I have been setting up branches to sort out CANCMDDC2. I set up some branches and decided to copy one into main using a pull request. I attempted to remove conflict by renaming BRANCHES.md in main and deleting the file. I could not merge that and needed to create a new file with the same name to complete the merge.

gitg shows branches usefully. It needs to be restarted to show all the branch tags properly.

I have now become familiar with updating a repository I have forked by updating the branch in GitHub desktop.

I have on one occasion cherrypicked between branches.

## VS Code configuration

I have had a lot of problems getting VS Code configured and at times I despaired of making sense of it. I have stuck with it and have learned quite a lot about how it works. There is still more to go.
