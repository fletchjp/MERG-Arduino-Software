# Test Encoder

These are a set of programs being used to test programming with an Encoder

All of these examples work with the IO abstraction library. Many are their own examples.

These are all for a UNO or clone unless stated otherwise.

I need to develop versions to test with a Keypad as well on a MEGA as part of the work for CANCMDDC.

## buttonRotaryEncoder

This is an IO Abstraction example which I have adapted to use the same pins as the EncoderOnly example.

## dfRobotRotaryEncoder

Not yet tested.

## EncoderOnly

This is based on Elegoo example 33 

## directionOnlyEncoder

Not yet tested.

## joystickRotaryEncoder
 
Not yet tested.
