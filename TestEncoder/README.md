# Test Encoder

These are a set of programs being used to test programming with an Encoder

All of these examples work with the IO abstraction library. Many are their own examples.

These are all for a UNO or clone unless stated otherwise.

I need to develop versions to test with a Keypad as well on a MEGA as part of the work for CANCMDDC.

I had done some work on the encoder previously which I have now recaptured.

It is worth noting that different makers describe the pins on the encoder differently.

I am following the description from Elegoo which is on the components I have.

## buttonRotaryEncoder

This is an IO Abstraction example which I have adapted to use the same pins as the EncoderOnly example.

## dfRobotRotaryEncoder

Not yet tested.

## EncoderOnly

This is based on Elegoo example 33 which uses the encoder for control.

## directionOnlyEncoder

Not yet tested.

## joystickRotaryEncoder
 
Not yet tested.
