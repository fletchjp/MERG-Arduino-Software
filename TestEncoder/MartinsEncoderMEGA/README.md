## MartinsEncoder

Test for encoder based on Martin Da Costa's library code.

The first version had the incrementing the wrong way.

The solution is to swap the pins in the software.

This version has pins for a MEGA

## Note

#include "EncoderMD.h"

This has been changed to use the EncoderMD library code.
