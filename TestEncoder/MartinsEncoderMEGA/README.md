## MartinsEncoder

Test for encoder based on Martin Da Costa's code.

The first version had the incrementing the wrong way.

The solution is to swap the pins in the software.

This version has pins for a MEGA

## Note

The library code needs to be updated to fix a bug Martin detected since I wrote the example.
