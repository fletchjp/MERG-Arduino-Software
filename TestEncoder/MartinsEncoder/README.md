## MartinsEncoder

Test for encoder based on Martin Da Costa's library code.

The first version had the incrementing the wrong way.

The solution is to swap the pins in the software when needed using SWAP_PINS.

This version has pins for a UNO or NANO

## Note

This has been changed to use the EncoderMD library code.
