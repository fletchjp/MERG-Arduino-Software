## MartinsEncoderSender

Test for encoder based on Martin Da Costa's library code.

The first version had the incrementing the wrong way.

The solution is to swap the pins in the software.

This version has pins for a UNO

This acts as a sender for I2C. It sends on request.

## Note

This has been changed to use the EncoderMD library code.
