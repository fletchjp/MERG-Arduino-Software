# Pico RP2040 Examples

There are some more examples to be described.

## Examples

I will be converting some examples to work with the Pico RP2040.

I am now able to use the equivalent of the Arduino Streaming library with the Pico code.

### BlinkWithSerialGPIO3

This is an example using the buttons and LEDs on the sb components breadboard kit.

I had lost track of the example.

### Multicore and MulticoreTalking

These are simple examples of use of the second core.

## PicoRP2040FCPP examples

These have now been moved to a separate folder.

## PicoSPIHatPins

SPI pins for the RS485 CAN Hat

## PicoRS485HatPins

## PicoRS485HatPins2

Another look at the pins for the RS485 CAN Hat being used with the Pico

## ACAN2040_test_v1

Test code for the ACAN2040 library.

## ACAN2040_CANHAT

Intended to use ACAN2040 with the CANHAT.
