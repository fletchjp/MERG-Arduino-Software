# Pico RP2040 Examples

There are some more examples to be described.

## Examples

I will be converting some examples to work with the Pico RP2040.

I am now able to use the equivalent of the Arduino Streaming library with the Pico code.

### BlinkWithSerialGPIO3

This is an example using the buttons and LEDs on the sb components breadboard kit.

I had lost track of the example.

### Multicore and MulticoreTalking

These are simple examples of use of the second core.

## PicoRP2040FCPP examples

These have now been moved to a separate folder.
