# Pico RP2040 codes

This folder is to work with files for the Pico RP2040 using the Arduino-pico system

I have found already that codes have to be distinct from the ones for the Arduino NANO RP2040 Connect as the output to the serial port has to be different.

## Examples

I will be converting some examples to work with the Pico RP2040.

I wanted to be able to use the equivalent of the Arduino Streaming library with the Pico code. I have found that is works.

The examples are described in a separate file
