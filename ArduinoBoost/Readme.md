# Boost 1.51.0

These examples have been run in the past using the AVR boards 1.8.2 which I had to use instead of 1.8.3

The current version of the AVR boards is 1.8.5 so I don't think it is worth continuing with these codes.

I will leave these in place in case anyone wants to investigate further.
