# Signal Composite

Experiments with the Composite Design Pattern using code developed in ArduinoSTL

This is based on ArduinoSTLComposite5 which supports multiple parents,

I have the thought to add something from the Observer Pattern so that there are updates.

One possibility is from the Detector to its parents.

I have now a version of the Observer Pattern working in ArduinoSTL as ArduinoSTLObserver.

## SignalComposite

A first example exploring the possibilities.

This soon ran out of memory on a UNO so I am using a MEGA instead.

I have something running which shows the building of a structure.

As yet there is no activity in it.

## Signal Combined

Experiments with the Composite Design Pattern using code developed in ArduinoSTL

This now being combined with the Observer Design Pattern from ArduinoSTLObserver6

A first example exploring the possibilities.
