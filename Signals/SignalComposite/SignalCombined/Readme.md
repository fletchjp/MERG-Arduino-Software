# SignalCombined

Experiments with the Composite Design Pattern using code developed in ArduinoSTL

This now being combined with the Observer Design Pattern from ArduinoSTLObserver6

A first example exploring the possibilities.

This is based on ArduinoSTLComposite5 which supports multiple parents,

This soon ran out of memory on a UNO so I am using a MEGA instead.

I have something running which shows the building of a structure.

There are now working examples of messages being passed.

It would be good to integrate the registration into the Composite pattern.
