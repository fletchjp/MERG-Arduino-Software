# Signal Composite

Experiments with the Composite Design Pattern using code developed in Arduin

A first example exploring the possibilities.

This is based on ArduinoSTLComposite5 which supports multiple parents,

This soon ran out of memory on a UNO so I am using a MEGA instead.

I have something running which shows the building of a structure.

As yet there is no activity in it.
