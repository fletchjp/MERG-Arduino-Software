# Arduino Signals examples

These are examples of Arduino code using Sven Rosvall's signal code and modifications.

The examples are grouped by signal function.

I am testing some of the examples and adding task management using TaskManagerIO (TM added to file names)

I am controlling the task management with an enum defining the state where this is relevant.

## CANSignals

These examples can link to CBUS.

## Signal2Aspect

These examples work with one two aspect signal.

## Signal3Aspect

These examples work with one three aspect signal.

## Two Signals

These examples work with two signals.
