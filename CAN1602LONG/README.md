## Long message example with pins and a display

This code supports a shield with buttons and a display with 2 rows of 16 characters.

It has been programmed so that the buttons send a long string message.

The display shows a received long string message.

The code sends on one stream ID and listens on several others.

The choice of stream IDs is made within the program.
