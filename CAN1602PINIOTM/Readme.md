# CAN1602PINIOTM

Extending CAN1602PINIO using LiquidCrystalIO DrawingEvent.

This has not yet been tested.

The updating of the screen is already being done through the SwitchInput class which provides switches.

This then calls the nominated routine logKeyPressed to do the update.

There is also update of the display in displayError and these may need to be coordinated.

There is more work to be done.
