# Boost Spirit X3 (Version 3) calculation examples

Back to [Boost Spirit X3 examples](BOOSTSPIRITX3.md)

There are a number of examples in Boost Spirit X3 Version 3.0.9 which develop a method for doing calculation.

I have adapted a number of theses examples to work towards the work I want to do for MERG.

### ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritCalc4c

A Calculator example demonstrating generation of AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).

The AST, once created, is traversed, 

1) To print its contents and

2) To evaluate the result.

### ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritCalc8



### ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritCalc8c

This is an attempt to combine the approach in Custom3 to diagnose incorrect input.
