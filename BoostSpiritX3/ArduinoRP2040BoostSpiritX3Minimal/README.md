## ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3Minimal

### Example of Boost Spirit X3 Minimal files

This example shows how to break down the employee example into separate files for different parts of the code.

Boost Spirit 3.0.0 is included from Arduino Boost (Boost 1.66.0)

This is taken from spirit/example/x3/minimal in Boost 1.77.0
and adapted to run on the Arduino NANO RP2040 connect.

This has involved a number of adaptions to the Arduino environment which are contained in the sketch file.

Common features are in ArduinoCode.h which can be used in other examples.

This file only runs on the Arduino NANO RP2040 connect.
