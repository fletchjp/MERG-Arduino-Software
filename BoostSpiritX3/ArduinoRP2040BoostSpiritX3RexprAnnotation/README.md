## ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3Rexpr Annotation

### Example of Boost Spirit X3 Rexpr Annotation

Boost Spirit 3.0.0 is included from Arduino Boost (Boost 1.66.0)

This is taken from spirit/example/x3/rexpr/rexpr_full 
and adapted to run on the Arduino NANO RP2040 connect.

This has involved a number of adaptions to the Arduino environment which are contained in the sketch file.

Error handling has been permanently disabled as exceptions are not supported.

Annotation being restored in this example.

This now gives the same output as the simple version for the test data.

Common features have been moved to ArduinoCode.h which can be used in other examples.

This file only runs on the Arduino NANO RP2040 connect.
