## ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3Annotation

### Example of Boost Spirit X3 Annotation

Boost Spirit 3.0.0 is included from Arduino Boost (Boost 1.66.0)

This is taken from spirit/example/x3/annotation from Boost 1.77.0
and adapted to run on the Arduino NANO RP2040 connect.

Common features have been moved to ArduinoCode.h which can be used in other examples.

This file only runs on the Arduino NANO RP2040 connect.

I have not been able to get the annotation to the original source string to work.

I do not have a use at the moment for the annotation.
