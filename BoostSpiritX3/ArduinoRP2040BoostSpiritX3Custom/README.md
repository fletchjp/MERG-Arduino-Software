## ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3Custom

### Example of Boost Spirit X3 Custom

Boost Spirit 3.0.0 is included from Arduino Boost (Boost 1.66.0)

This is an example implementing custom diagnosis
and adapted to run on the Arduino NANO RP2040 connect.

So far it does diagnosis on success and the failure message does not appear.

This has involved a number of adaptions to the Arduino environment which are contained in the sketch file.

Common features have been moved to ArduinoCode.h which can be used in other examples.

This file only runs on the Arduino NANO RP2040 connect.
