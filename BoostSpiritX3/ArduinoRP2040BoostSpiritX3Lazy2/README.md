## ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3Lazy2

### Example of Boost Spirit X3 Lazy2

Boost Spirit 3.0.0 is included from Arduino Boost (Boost 1.66.0)

This is based on an example: 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60171119/boost-spirit-x3-lazy-parser

I was lead to this looking for examples of subcontext and any_parser, both of which are in X3 and lack examples.

I am going to see if I can after all get this to work using what I have learned in LazyParser6.

Being adapted from the variant example.

This has involved a number of adaptions to the Arduino environment which are contained in the sketch file.

Common features have been moved to ArduinoCode.h which can be used in other examples.

This file only runs on the Arduino NANO RP2040 connect.
