# ArduinoSTL examples

Some examples using the ArduinoSTL library.

## ArduinoSTLHello

Basic example

## ArduinoSTLIntegers

## ArduinoSTLVector

Simple vector example with range based for loop example.

## ArduinoSTLComposite

Example of the Composite Pattern which is now working.

## ArduinoSTLComposite2

Example of the Composite Pattern with the composite classes in a header.

## ArduinoSTLComposite3

Example of the Composite Pattern with the composite classes in a header.

Using list instead of vector for the children.

## ArduinoSTLComposite4

The code has been changed to use a different example from refactoring.guru.

This supports holding parent information (on one parent).

I have retained the support of named items and added GetName to return the information.

## ArduinoSTLComposite5

This extends the previous example to allow for multiple parents.

I have now used this as a starting point for SignalComposite.
