# Local Chat Examples

These use SoftwareBitBang to implement chat between two Arduinos.

These are adapted from a wireless example in the PJON library.

There are two examples, with and without task management using TaskManagerIO to show how this can be used.

A copy of the code is run in each of two Arduino UNOs connected between pin 12 on each, with a ground connection as well.

Choose a number between 1 and 254 as an address for each and run the codeon each. Instructions on how to connect appear in the Serial Monitor.

These examples are discussed in a talk to the MERG Arduino SIG on 24th September 2024.
