# Local Chat Examples

These use SoftwareBitBang to implement chat between two Arduinos.

These are adapted from a wireless example in the PJON library.

There are two examples, with and without task management using TaskManagerIO to show how this can be used.

These examples are discussed in a talk to the MERG Arduino SIG on 24th September 2024.
