Basic examples using the Serial port

## UNO

The problem for me is that on a UNO I also use the Serial port to see what is going on.


## SoftwareSerial

The alternative is to use other pins and SoftwareSerial

I now have this working sending a PJON message.

## Other Boards

UNO boards only have one Serial port so I can use some other things which have more ports.

The MEGA has three more serial ports

The DUE has three more ports which are 3.3V ports.

I am starting an example TransmitterDue
