# Arduinos connected together using PJON

This contains some examples collected to show the use of PJON.

## What is PJON?

See https://www.pjon.org/ 

It is a networking protocol which can run over a variety of systems.

# Any

Examples with multiple connections.

# ThroughSerial 

## Serial ports directly connected

## BlinkTest

Basic examples using the Serial port.

I have a set using SoftSerial for a second serial port for the Arduino UNO.

## BlinkWithResponse

Example with response using the Serial port.

I have a set using SoftSerial for a second serial port for the Arduino UNO.

## Keypad

The BlinkTest example has been extended to pass the key press on the keypad to the receiving Arduino.

## RS485 over Serial

## RS485-Blink

Not yet tried out. I have started to build examples using SoftSerial.

## RS485-BlinkWithResponse

Not yet tried out.

# SoftwareBitBang

An alternative connection to ThroughSerial using only one wire.
