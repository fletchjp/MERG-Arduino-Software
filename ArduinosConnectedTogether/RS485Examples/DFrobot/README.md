# DFRobot DFR0219 example codes

These are codes for the DFR0219 Arduino shields which have now arrived.

## RS485TransmitingData

## RS485ReceivingData

These are examples from the shield description. Each only does one way transmission.

When I have these working I will look at using Auto485 as well.

## RS485AutoData

First try with Auto485 in use.

I have made a small change to my copy of Auto485 to remove an Arduino warning message.
