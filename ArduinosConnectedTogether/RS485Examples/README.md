# Arduinos connected together using PJON

This contains some examples collected to show the use of RS485 between arduinos.

I have done some work on this in the past and will collect the code here.

That was done before I had the Totem frames to organise the hardware, so I think all the wiring has been taken apart.

## PJON using RS485 over Serial

I have moved these PJON examples here as they use RS485

### RS485-Blink

Not yet tried out. I have started to build examples using SoftSerial.

### RS485-BlinkWithResponse

Not yet tried out.
