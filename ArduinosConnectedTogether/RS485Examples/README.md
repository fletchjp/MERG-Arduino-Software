# Arduinos connected together using RS485

This contains some examples collected to show the use of RS485 between arduinos.

I have done some work on this in the past and will collect the code here.

That was done before I had the Totem frames to organise the hardware, so I think all the wiring has been taken apart.

## Hardware for RS485

I have used external RS485 boards in the past. I now have on order some DFRobot boards DFR0219 which have an RS485 port.

I also have a board for a Raspberry Pi which I want to use with a Raspberry Pi Pico. I have not yet found software for this.

## Protocols over RS485

There is a need for way of working to be defined to use RS485. This is often referred to as the protocol.

I want to explore a number of different protocols here.

### PJON

I already have some examples of this although I have not yet run them.

I have been reading the documentation for these and it is not clear to me what pins are available for the hardware serial example.

## PJON using RS485 over Serial

I have moved these PJON examples here as they use RS485

### RS485-Blink

Not yet tried out. I have started to build examples using SoftSerial.

### RS485-BlinkWithResponse

Not yet tried out.
