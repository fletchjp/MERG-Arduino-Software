# Arduinos connected together

When I started this the codes were in two separate sections. This has now become complicated.

Most of the important current examples are in I2Cexamples/TwoWayExample where there are several cases.

Some of these combine I2C and PJON communication.

The main code is actually in TestDisplay/LiquidCrystalIO where the code also does I2C to an Arduino.

## Arduinos connected together using I2C

This contains some public domain examples adapted slightly and now quite a lot more.

## Arduinos connected together using PJON

This contains some examples collected to show the use of PJON.

These examples include some Bitbang experiments with the Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Arduinos connected together using RS485

I have some previous examples which I am going to add in here.

It is also possible to use PJON with RS485 and I will keep codes for this here too.

I am going to do quite a lot more now with RS485 some of it using the DFR0219 shields.
