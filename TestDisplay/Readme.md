 ## Test Display
 
 This is a collection of test programs for Arduino display options.
 
 ### LiquidCrystalIO
 
 I am collecting some examples for this library which works with TaskmanagerIO.
 
 TaskMgrIntegration is one which shows how to build the screen updating into a task.
 
 Counter23017 shows how to use the task manager to schedule updating of the screen.
 
 The code is integrated with the IOAbstraction and TaskmanagerIO libraries.
