# MERG-Arduino-Software

 ## Test Display
 
 This is a collection of test programs for Arduino display options. The supplied programs are for a 16 by 2 display.
 
 ### LiquidCrystalIO
 
 I am collecting some examples for this library which works with TaskmanagerIO.
 
 TaskMgrIntegration is one which shows how to build the screen updating into a task.
 
 Counter23017 shows how to use the task manager to schedule updating of the screen.
 
 The code is integrated with the IOAbstraction and TaskmanagerIO libraries.
 
 I am extending the examples to include a 20 by 4 display, starting with HelloI2C20x4 to sort out the basics.

 TaskMgrI2C20x4 is new code to implement task management in the style of TaskMgrIntegration with a different problem.
