# LiquidCrystalIO
 
 I am collecting some examples for this library which works with TaskmanagerIO.
  
 For details of the library see https://www.thecoderscorner.com/products/arduino-libraries/liquidcrystal-io/
 
 There is mention that there are advantages in using this as the task manager can do other tasks while the display is updating.
 
 There is a limitation that only one task manager task should draw to the display.
 
 I am looking for examples which illustrates this point.
 
 ## TaskMgrIntegration 
 
 This is one which shows how to build the screen updating into a task.
 
 ## Counter23017 
 
 This shows how to use the task manager to schedule updating of the screen.
 
 The library code is at https://github.com/davetcc/LiquidCrystalIO on Github.
 
 ## TaskMgrI2C20x4 
 
 This shows how to build in tasks.
 
 ## MEGATaskIntegration 
 
 This will add the display to code on a MEGA which has a keypad and two encoders as well.
 
 This is now mounted in the red Totem frame.
