# LiquidCrystalIO
 
 I am collecting some examples for this library which works with TaskmanagerIO.
  
 For details of the library see https://www.thecoderscorner.com/products/arduino-libraries/liquidcrystal-io/
 
 There is mention that there are advantages in using this as the task manager can do other tasks while the display is updating.
 
 There is a limitation that only one task manager task should draw to the display.
 
 I am looking for examples which illustrates this point.
 

 ## TaskMgrI2C20x4 
 
 This shows how to build in tasks.
