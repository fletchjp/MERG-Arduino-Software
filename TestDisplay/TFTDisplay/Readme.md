# TFT Display
 
 This is a collection of test programs for Arduino use of TFT displays. 

## ELEGOO

I have several displays from ELEGOO 

I have had problems with the libraries supplied by ELEGOO so I am using something different.
 
## MCUFRIEND_kbv
 
This is a library which I am using to run the displays.
 
I have copied two of the basic tests from the library.
 
### diagnose_TFT_support

There are FAQs in extras/mcufriend_how_to.txt

tft.readID() finds: ID = 0x9341

MCUFRIEND_kbv version: 3.0.0

PORTRAIT is 240 x 320

Run the examples/graphictest_kbv sketch
All colours, text, directions, rotations, scrolls
should work.  If there is a problem,  make notes on paper
Post accurate description of problem to Forum
Or post a link to a video (or photos)

I rely on good information from remote users

### graphictest_kbv
 
This does what it says.  Note that the serial monitor runs at 9600.
 
Serial took 0ms to start
ID = 0x9341
 
### DisplayStringMCUFRIEND

One of the Elegoo examples modified so that it works.
