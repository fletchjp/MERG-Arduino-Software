# Boost Spirit pages

I am planning to use Boost Spirit for the parsing of input such as the CANCOMPUTE input code.

It is also capable of generating strings from structured data and so could be used to pass strings over CBUS.

## Boost Spirit Examples

This is becoming an important area of work as it is possible that Boost Spirit could be used to decode CANCOMPUTE files with possible enhancements.

It can be used both to decode a string to a structure set of values and also used to generate strings from values. This means that it could be used to develop ways to send information over CBUS using RFC 0005 methods.
