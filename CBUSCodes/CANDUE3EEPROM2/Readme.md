# CANDUE3EEPROM2

This is a copy of CANDUE3EEPROM to test the operation of the autoformat operation in Arduino IDE 2.2.1

This example expands CANDUE3 to allow for the optional use of external EEPROM

This is under test and I have added a new option 'd' in the Serial Port to print out the first 20 bytes of the EEPROM to find out what is going on.

This is now working and keeping the configuration.
