# Test Encoder and Keypad

These are a set of programs being used to test programming with an Encoder and a Keypad.

These use code from both the Test Encoder and Test Keypad programs. 

There are two types of keypad, both with 4 rows of keys. One sort have three columns and the other four columns.

I have code to support both types.

I also want to support direct pin access from an Arduino MEGA and I2C access from an Arduino UNO or NANO.

I have developed some codes for testing the different applications.

Most of these examples work with the IO abstraction library.

Example of matrix keyboard support for MEGA with a 3 by 4 Keypad built into IoAbstraction with encoder

This is now adapted to report the state of the key.
