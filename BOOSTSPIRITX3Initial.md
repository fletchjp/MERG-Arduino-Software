# Boost Spirit X3 (Version 3) initial examples

Back to [Boost Spirit X3 examples](BOOSTSPIRITX3.md)

These examples are adaptions of the ones which are in Boost Spirit X3 and documented online.

### ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3Actions

An exploration of some ways of using Boost Spirit X3 in comparison with the other version of this file.

### ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3NumList1

Taken from spirit/example/x3/num_list/num_list1

These examples do the same example introducing features one by one.

### ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3NumList2

Taken from spirit/example/x3/num_list/num_list2

From this point on the results are stored in a vector.

### ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3NumList3

Taken from spirit/example/x3/num_list/num_list3

### ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3NumList4

Taken from spirit/example/x3/num_list/num_list4


### ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3Roman

Taken from spirit/example/x3/Roman

This shows how to combine parsers into a more complex operations.

### ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3Employee

Taken from spirit/example/x3/employee

This shows how to input data to a structure.

I have not been able to use the boost Fusion output option and have made my own output routine.

I have been able to test using Boost Fusion access routines.

### ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3Minimal

This is a version of the employee example broken into separate files for the different parts of the problem.

The idea is that they can be considered separately and may be components of different problems.

### ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3Annotation

This example is not in Boost 1.66.0. I have taken it from Boost 1.77.0.

It was not difficult to adapt using code from the employee example.

This extends the employee example using annotation to add access iterators.

I have not succeeded in getting the new features to work properly.

### ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3Annotation2

This extends the Annotation example to add an employee number.

### ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3Annotation3

This extends the Annotation example to add an entry structure with number separate.

I am learning how to change the structures.

### ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3Annotation4

This extends the Annotation example to add building a map using the number as a key.

Note that the map entry is made using a std::pair.

### ArduinoRP2040BoostSpiritX3Annotation5

This extends the Annotation example to check the map for a duplicate key and not make that entry.
