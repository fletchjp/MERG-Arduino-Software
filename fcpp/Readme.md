# fcpp library files

These files are a copy of the fcpp library in Arduino/libraries. That is the location which is used for compilation.

These copies will be used to update fcpp and provide a backup of the files in use.

At the moment there are only a few changes to make the files Arduino compatible for use with RP2040 devices.
