# RP2040

This branch is to work with files for the Arduino NANO RP2040 Connect boards using the Arduino-pico system

## Introduction

These are very new boards and the documentation for them is still being developed.

The boards work at 3.3V which presents some challenges compared to the previous work with other Arduino boards.

## Simple examples

I am building simple examples to explore the capabilities of the RP2040.

## CBUS examples

I have also a number of examples exploring connecting to CBUS.
