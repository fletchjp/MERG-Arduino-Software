# RP2040

This branch is to work with files for the Arduino NANO RP2040 Connect boards using the Arduino-pico system

## Introduction

These are very new boards and the documentation for them is still being developed.

The boards work at 3.3V which presents some challenges compared to the previous work with other Arduino boards.

## Simple examples

I am building simple examples to explore the capabilities of the RP2040.

## CBUS examples

I have also a number of examples exploring connecting to CBUS.

## Boost examples

I am converting some of the examples I developed for the Arduino DUE using Boost 1.66.0

### ArduinoRP2040STLBind

This example uses standard library and Boost headers to set up deletion from a list of strings, using either STL directly or Boost bind.

I needed to put in flashing the LED to get it to work for a reason I do not understand.

### ArduinoRP2040STLPhoenix

I have extended the previous example to include two more cases using Boost Phoenix for comparison.

The only new problem was caused by the failure of boost/phoenix/core/debug.hpp to compile I think because it uses <iostream>.

I have contditionally removed it from boost/phoenix/core.hpp.
