# RP2040

This branch is to work with files for the Arduino NANO RP2040 Connect boards using the Arduino-pico system

## Introduction

These are very new boards and the documentation for them is still being developed.

The boards work at 3.3V which presents some challenges compared to the previous work with other Arduino boards.

## Simple examples

I am building simple examples to explore the capabilities of the RP2040.

## CBUS examples

I have also a number of examples exploring connecting to CBUS.

I plan to connect to CBUS using a MCP2515 unit. As this is a 5V unit and the RP2040 is 3.3V I need connecting hardware.

## Boost examples

I am converting some of the examples I developed for the Arduino DUE using Boost 1.66.0. The STL in the example names comes from the situation on the DUE where I have a separate STL library which is not needed on the RP2040.

I have made a lot of progress with this towards having a working system where I can take advantage of the GCC 10 with C++17 which is available.

### ArduinoRP2040STLBind

This example uses standard library and Boost headers to set up deletion from a list of strings, using either STL directly or Boost bind.

I now have a version of this which uses only std and not boost, developed when I had no access to the Boost libraries.

I needed to put in flashing the LED to get it to work for a reason I do not understand.

### ArduinoRP2040STLPhoenix

I have extended the previous example to include two more cases using Boost Phoenix for comparison.

The only new problem was caused by the failure of boost/phoenix/core/debug.hpp to compile I think because it uses the C++ iostream header.

I have conditionally removed it from boost/phoenix/core.hpp and the example runs without it.

### ArduinoRP2040BoostFunction

This example develops the use of Boost Function including an infix operator from BoostFC++.

This uses the Streaming library for output to the Serial port.
