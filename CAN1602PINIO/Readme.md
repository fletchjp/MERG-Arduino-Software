# CAN1602PINIO

First experiment using LiquidCrystalIO with the code from CAN1602PIN.

This runs as expected.

The updating of the screen is already being done through the SwitchInput class which provides switches.

This then calls the nominated routine logKeyPressed to do the update.

There is also update of the display in displayError and these may need to be coordinated.

There is therefore less to be done than I expected for this case.
