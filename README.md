# MERG-Arduino-Software
 
 ## Software for MERG Arduino projects

 I am aiming to help MERG members to collect together Arduino software for projects.

 Some projects will make use of libraries which are already somewhere else on Github.

 ## Events

 29th November 2020. I have added pwmtest as an experiment to see what would happen. It is a test for the addresses of I2C devices.

 25th February 2021. I am restarting this work as a result of Sven Rosvall's Zoom talk to the Arduino SIG. After some discussion with him I am going to have a series of different repositories for different pieces of software.
 I have set up a project in my ConnectedText wiki where I can document the repositories and their relationships.
 To start with the work in progress will remain on the local computer and not be moved to the public site on GitHub.

 Overall documentation of what is going on can be done here.

## Learning

 I have just made a discovery. I went to commit this and found that I was on the RS485 branch, which probably needs to become a separate repository.
 I had made the changes on that branch and was able to change branches and take the changes with me. I did not know that was possible.

## Queries

I would like to move the whole RS485 branch to be a separate repository. At the moment I do not know how to do that. 

### Syntax

I will document my learning of the Markdown syntax here.  At the moment all I have done is to add some headings and can see how they work.
